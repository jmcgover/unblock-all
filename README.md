# unblock-all
A javascript script that unblocks all of a Twitter user's blocked Twitter accounts

# Overview
Unblocking everyone blocked on Twitter involves navigating to the blocked accounts (https://twitter.com/settings/blocked) page, scrolling down to the bottom until webpage loads the next few accounts, and then clicking the Ublock button one by one.
This script attempts to automate the process of scrolling until everyone is loaded, finding the block buttons, and automatically clicking them.
The `unblock.js` script performs each of those tasks by scrolling to the bottom of the page, waiting for it to load via a set timeout, and then continuing to scroll until it observes no difference in scroll height.
Once the script can no longer scroll, it finds all of the unblock buttons, by searching for the `'blocked-text'` class elements (Ã  la https://gist.github.com/themorgantown/3e3e6a42e17ebcbc766c) and clicking on each of them individually.

# Usage

1. Paste the contents of ``unblock.js`` into the Console window. Press `Enter`.

1. Let it chooch
